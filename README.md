## Intro and Install
A userscript is a JavaScript that will be injected to the specified websites before/when/after a webpage is loaded. You can think of it as a lightweight browser extension. To install this userscript, you need to:

- First, install a userscript manager. There are some famous ones, and this script should be compatible with anyone of them.
    - [Violentmonkey]( https://violentmonkey.github.io/get-it/ ): An **opensource** WebExtension-based manager, which is **modern** and works for Firefox and chromium-based browsers. This is recommended.
    - [Greasemonkey]( https://www.greasespot.net/ ): Another **opensource** manager. This is **the original** extension that proposed the idea of userscript, and is compatible to most scripts therefore. But it is older, heavier and only works for Firefox.
    - [Tampermonkey]( https://www.tampermonkey.net/ ): The **most popular** userscript manager. It has good compatibility therefore, but it is closed-source. 
- Then, [click here]( https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Makereal-Labs/club_cafe_music/refs/heads/user-script/main.user.js ) to install. The userscript manager should ask you whether to install, confirm and close the page.
- At the end, open YouTube and find a song. Then, move your cursor to the middle-right of the window, and you should see a button. Click it to play the music in Makereal Labs Cafe Music System. Then, VOILÀ!
